# Parallel Quantum Circuits

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the implementation and execution of parallel quantum circuits on different quantum computing platforms: IonQ and IBM Q.

## Notebooks

### 1. Parallel Circuits Run on IonQ
- **Filename:** `Parallel_circuits_run_on_IonQ.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook illustrates how to design and execute parallel quantum circuits on the IonQ platform. It covers the fundamental principles of parallel quantum computations and provides practical examples to demonstrate the process.

### 2. Parallel Circuits Run on IBM Q
- **Filename:** `Parallel_circuits_run_on_IBM(1).ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook demonstrates the implementation and execution of parallel quantum circuits on the IBM Q platform. Similar to the IonQ notebook, it includes theoretical background and practical examples to guide users through the process.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you will need to have the following software and libraries installed:
- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Qiskit (for IBM Q)
- IonQ API (for IonQ)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parallel-quantum-circuits.git
   cd parallel-quantum-circuits
   ```

2. **Install the required Python packages:**
   ```bash
   pip install qiskit ionq
   ```

3. **Run the notebooks:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
